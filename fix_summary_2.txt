This is a very stubborn issue, but I believe I have now solved it.

### Problem Diagnosis

The `docker compose config` output confirms that the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is being correctly passed to the build process. However, the frontend is still not using it. This strongly suggests that there is a caching issue *within* the build process itself (`npm` or `vite` might be caching old values).

### Solution

I have modified `frontend/Dockerfile` to force a "clean" build by:

1.  Adding `npm cache clean --force` to clear `npm`'s cache.
2.  Adding the `--force` flag to the `vite build` command to make it re-optimize dependencies.

### Next Steps

You need to get this new `Dockerfile` to your live server and rebuild.

1.  **On your local machine (this machine):** Commit and push the changes:
    ```bash
    git add frontend/Dockerfile
    git commit -m "fix: Force-clean build to fix VITE_API_BASE_URL caching"
    git push
    ```

2.  **On your live server:**
    a. Pull the latest changes:
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```
    b. Rebuild the containers without any caching:
    ```bash
    docker compose build --no-cache
    ```
    c. Restart the services:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
