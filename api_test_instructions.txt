To fetch data from the API for testing purposes, you need to authenticate by obtaining an access token and including it in your requests.

Here's how to do it:

**Step 1: Obtain an Access Token**
Send a POST request to the /login endpoint with the admin username and password.

Command (copy and paste this into your terminal):
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/login" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=admin&password=admin123"

This will return a JSON object with an 'access_token' (a long string) and 'token_type' (usually 'bearer').
Make sure to copy the 'access_token' value.

**Step 2: Use the Access Token for Authenticated Requests**
Include the 'access_token' in the 'Authorization' header of your subsequent requests as a Bearer token.

Command (replace YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN with the token you copied from Step 1):
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/stock/" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"

This will allow you to make authenticated requests to the /stock/ endpoint (and other protected endpoints).
